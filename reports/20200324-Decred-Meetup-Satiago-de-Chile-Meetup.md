## Overall experience

This meetup was to be held in person in the city of Santiago de Chile, but due to the spread of COVID19 and the border closure between countries we had to do it online.

There was a lot of expectation since many people were waiting for this meetup. Attendance was good and the number of connected remained stable throughout the talk.

We introduced Decred and answered several questions about it. The experience was innovative but definitely the contact with the public is not the same. However, this methodology allowed the participation of more attendees as we had been receiving in past events.
