## Overall Experience

It was the first time that we held a meetup inside an academic establishment (ORT Uruguay). This was very remarkable in terms of the public since the meetup was advertised within the university several days before.

The Montevideo community is very small, there are only a few who know about cryptocurrencies and fewer who know about Decred. However, they were very interested in the project and several of them joined the [DecredES](https://t.me/DecredES) Telegram channel.

At the end of the exhibition, many questions were answered while enjoying snacks.

## Outcomes and Learnings

- An academy on fintech and new technologies was very interested in including Decred in their talks, so we are in contact for future events (https://revolution4.com.uy).

- The ORT University of Montevideo was also satisfied. We met their rector and had good conversations.

- The academic environment is key to the development of these meetups since the biggest stakeholders are in these establishments.
