## Overall Experience

We chose the city of Santa Fe as the first city outside the capital of Argentina due to the lack of knowledge of the community but the number of people interested in the subject. We made this deduction from the crowded events organized by Iñaki Apezteguia (co-founder of blocknia) who was our ally and helped us promote the event in the city.

The event was held on a rooftop in the city with a turnout that met our expectations. The people were very interested and after the talk, a large part of the group stayed talking to us with more questions than they did before.

The attendees were mainly in the industrial and student sectors.

## Outcomes and Learnings

-We met a very new community that knows little about cryptocurrencies. These types of people are very interested in hearing about crypto and more about a project that transcends the everyday.

-We strengthen relations with Iñaki who has a great impact on the city. 

-We met a representative of the community of paraná (a city near santa fe with equal potential of stakeholders).
