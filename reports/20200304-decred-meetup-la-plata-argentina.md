## Overall Experience

The city of La Plata is a very important epicenter after the city of Buenos Aires in terms of the crypto community. There are many important representatives and a large population working on crypto-projects. Our contacts there provided us with a space and 100% availability to carry out this meetup. Many people interested in adding value to the project approached.

This time, in addition to introducing Decred, we talked about how to be a contractor, which was well received by the public.

The meetup was held in a coworking "Espacio weiaut" in the center of the city of La Plata.

## Outcomes and Learnings

- We meet again with a community that knows the subject, wanting to understand more complex concepts of the project.

- The interest generated by adding value to the project was high and we had quite a few questions about how to do it.
